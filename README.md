# Rapid-Response-Team-in-SGH_Data-Analysis-with-Python
<h2> Introduction </h2>
Before a pharmaceutical drug is made available to the public, it needs to go through rigorous and lengthy clinical testing and regulatory approvals, spanning 6 to 7 years and costing between $160 million to $2 billion per new drug. The testing process involves clinical trials which are conducted in 3 main phases to ensure a drug’s safety and effectiveness before it can be considered for approval. Phase 1 involves a small group of healthy volunteers to evaluate safety and determine appropriate dosage. If successful, the drug moves to Phase 2, which tests its effectiveness in a few hundred patients and continues to monitor side effects. Phase 3 expands to several hundred or thousands of patients to confirm the drug’s efficacy. Upon successful completion, the drug may be submitted for regulatory approval.

<h2> Goals </h2>
1) To analyze the factors influencing  the number of RRT activations such as Teams (SICU VS MICU Triage) and Hours (Office VS Non-Office). <br>
2) To analyze the impact of RRT activations on immediate Disposition and hospitalization Outcome. 
<br>
<br>
<h2> Target Audience </h2>
1)	The Chief Regulatory Officer (CRO) of a pharmaceutical company looking to increase the approval rate of their drug development pipeline. <br>
2)	A Venture Capitalist in the pharma industry evaluating risk and timeline of returns on drug development investments. <br>
3)	An Academic Researcher in the field of public health studying the factors influencing clinical trial efficiency and drug approval rates. <br>
<br>
<h2> Data Sources </h2>
1)	SICU and MICU Triage data from SGH. <br>
2)	Patient Outcomes from SGH. <br>
* The data originally comes from kaggle and uploaded on the repository for easy reference.  
<br>
<br>
<h2> Data Limitation </h2>
Unable to differentiate between different hospitalizations for the same patient, difficulty in matching outcomes to triage data when there are multiple outcomes per patient.
