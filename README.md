<h2> Introduction </h2>
Singapore General Hospital (SGH) is trying to improve the allocation efficiency of hospital resources. I was tasked with providing actionable insights on how to better allocate hospital resource through the analysis and visualisation of Rapid Response Team (RRT) data in SGH.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Problem Statement </h2>
To provide recommendations on how to better allocate hospital resources, especically during a health crisis.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Goals </h2>
1) To analyze the factors influencing  the number of RRT activations such as Teams (SICU VS MICU Triage) and Hours (Office VS Non-Office). <br>
2) To analyze the impact of RRT activations on immediate Disposition and hospitalization Outcome. 
<br>
<br>
<h2> Target Audience </h2>
1)	A Doctor on the RRT who needs to make every second count and make sure patients receive the right help at the right time. <br>
2)	Hospital Administrators who are in-charge of resource allocation, staffing levels, and strategic planning for rapid response coverage. <br>
3)	A ward nurse who wants to be prepared during a health crisis so she can better support the RRT. <br>
<br>
<h2> Data Sources </h2>
1)	SICU and MICU Triage data from SGH. <br>
2)	Patient Outcomes from SGH. <br>
* The data originally comes from kaggle and uploaded on the repository for easy reference.  
<br>
<br>
<h2> Data Limitation </h2>
Unable to differentiate between different hospitalizations for the same patient, difficulty in matching outcomes to triage data when there are multiple outcomes per patient.
